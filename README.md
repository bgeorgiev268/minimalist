# Minimal Test Suite
A large code base results in a large test set if always all tests need to be run when one does a change.
Yet, not all tests cover test cases which are effectively affected by a change. 
This library shall help to reduce the time needed to verify changes against a test set but still keep up a good coverage of affected test cases.
